# Snap Attendance

Snap Attendance is the new quick way for Chandigarh University's students for fetching their attendance, which shows their attendance of various subjects straight out of the box and also saves user's from painful logins again and again. Also there are fields which are auto calculated to let you know, how many lectures are more required according to university's standard and saves you from getting DEBAR.

App is built with REACT Framework and has a beautiful and minimal UI to save user from clutter
